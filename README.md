## Neck joints
The neck consists of several joints that allow for movement and flexibility. The main joints in the neck include:
Atlanto-occipital joint: This joint connects the base of the skull (occipital bone) with the first cervical vertebra (atlas). It allows for nodding or flexion and extension movements of the head.
Atlantoaxial joint: This joint is formed between the first cervical vertebra (atlas) and the second cervical vertebra (axis). It enables rotational movements of the head, such as shaking or rotating the head from side to side.
Zygapophyseal joints: These are the facet joints located on the sides of the vertebrae. They connect adjacent vertebrae and permit various movements, including flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation.
Intervertebral joints: These are the joints between the individual cervical vertebrae. They are made up of intervertebral discs, which act as shock absorbers, and allow for slight movement, such as bending and twisting.
